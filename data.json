In 1998 ACTS joined forces with the City of Philadelphiaâ€™s Department of Behavioral Health and Office of Addiction Services (DBH/OAS) in order to facilitate a Supportive (Recovery) House. The Recovery House is for adult women in Substance Abuse Treatment and Recovery Programs, as well as women who were recently incarcerated.",
